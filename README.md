## Gorillaz Band page

The gorillaz are one of my faviorte bands of alltime so I deciced to make a webpage dedicated to them for this assignment and my cpastone. I plan adding much more pages for capstone and more functionality.

This was my first time creating a website with Intelij and I found it to be a pleasent exprience. The styling of this page was very difficult for me becuase Im not really used to bootstrap so alot of it doesnt look how I want it to look.


1. index.html -   In this page I wanted to display photos of the gorillaz as well as display their albums. The way I did this was using the bootstrap feature called carousell that allows you to cycle through images. And I also used Iframes from spotify to show thier disocography.

2. about.html - This page shows of the memebers via gifs and gives a short bio

3. Store.html - This is the page where I'll make my e-commerce website for my capstone

4. Login- Is where users will login or sign up so there can put item in the cart ans check out.

## Gorillaz Band page

# Go to najibels.github.io to access the page


The Gorillaz are one of my favorite bands of all time so I decided to make a webpage dedicated to them for this assignment and my capstone. I plan to add much more pages for capstone and more functionality.

This was my first time creating a website with IntelliJ and I found it to be a pleasant experience. The styling of this page was very difficult for me because I'm not really used to bootstrap so alot of it doesn't look how I want it to look.


1. index.html - On this page, I wanted to display photos of the Gorillaz as well as display their albums. The way I did this was using the bootstrap feature called carousel which allows you to cycle through images. And I also used Iframes from Spotify to show their discography.

2. about.html - This page shows the members via gifs and gives a short bio

3. Store.html - This is the page where I'll make my e-commerce website for my capstone

4. Login- This is where users will log in or sign up so there can put an item in the cart and check out
